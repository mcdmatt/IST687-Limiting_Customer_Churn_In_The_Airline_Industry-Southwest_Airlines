# Limiting_Customer_Churn_In_The_Airline_Industry-Southwest_Airlines
Southeast Airlines needed to lower their customer churn (sometimes referred to as customer attrition). Like many airlines, Southeast has, up until now, believed that the best way to minimize customer churn was to have a robust loyalty program for frequent flyers. However, their customers were valuing the loyalty program less, which was one reason why just relying on their loyalty program might not be sufficient in keeping low customer churn. Additionally, customer churn is actually a lagging indicator, meaning the loss has already occurred. As such, it was a measurement of the damage inflicted. The real goal is to reduce churn by getting ahead of the loss (of the customer) by identifying some leading indicators, or metrics, that might help keep a customer. In other words, these leading indicators, or metrics, could help identify when a customer was about to stop flying Southeast. These insights could provide actionable suggestions as to how to avoid having the customers leave and go to another airline.  This project involves data pre-processing/preparation/manipulation, predictive modeling/analysis/mapping, and actionable business insights to upper management.
